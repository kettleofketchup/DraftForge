Tournaments have multiple types:
- Swiss, Double elimination, and single elimination

I want to create tournament brackets and slots for models that map next game, previous game, and linking games that from other bracket rounds. I will be using this information to create a tournament bracket map in react flow linking the games in a visiual map. I don't need frontend design, only backend right now.


EX for linking:  decide who plays in a round 2 if it dertmines in round 1's game a and game b

Can you create the models for this and explain from an database design perspective and break down dependencies and links?
