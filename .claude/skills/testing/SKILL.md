description: DraftForge test infrastructure for writing backend unit tests, Playwright E2E tests, and managing test data population. This skill should be used when writing new tests, adding test fixtures, creating populate functions for new features, adding Playwright E2E specs, using login/auth fixtures, creating test users/orgs/leagues/tournaments, or understanding the test data architecture. Covers backend Django tests via Docker, Playwright config (projects, workers, sharding), test auth endpoints that expose backend login to frontend, and feature-isolated test data patterns.

# DraftForge Testing Infrastructure

## Self-Updating

This skill documents live code. When modifying test infrastructure, update the relevant reference file.
To verify current state, read the source files referenced in each section.

## Architecture Overview

Two-layer test data system:
1. **Data definitions** (`backend/tests/data/`) - Pydantic models (TestUser, TestOrganization, TestLeague, TestTeam, TestTournament)
2. **Populate functions** (`backend/tests/populate/`) - Create DB records from data definitions

Backend exposes `/api/tests/*` endpoints (TEST=true only) so Playwright can login, reset state, and create test-specific data.

## Key Principle: Feature-Isolated Test Data

Each feature's E2E tests MUST use dedicated test data. Never reuse another feature's org/league/tournament.

See [references/feature-isolation.md](references/feature-isolation.md) for the full pattern.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Backend (Docker - use --entrypoint "" to bypass daphne)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yaml run --rm --entrypoint "" backend \
  python manage.py test app.tests.test_csv_import -v 2

# Playwright
just test::pw::headless              # All tests
just test::pw::spec csv-import       # Specific suite
just test::pw::ui                    # Interactive UI mode

# Full setup (down, update, build, populate, up)
just test::setup

# Repopulate test data only
just db::populate::all
```
